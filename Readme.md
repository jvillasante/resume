# My Latex resume

Linkedin serves well, but not in all situations.  At some point my profile
just cluttered up, while all I wanted 'them' to have is a good looking
two page resume.  Naturally turned to Latex.

Looking at some Latex resumes online I found non that I really liked, so
I gave it my best shot.  The I documented my effort here on Github as I
expect more geeks want their resume to be typeset like this.

It uses TeX Gyre Pagella, a font similar to Pallatino that is often used for
books.  When compiled with XeLaTeX it has 'lower case numerals', which I
think look very nice.

Except the horizonal lines and bullets everything is made of text.
Hyper-refs are used where applicable, all in dark blue so 'print safe'.

A 'last updated at** date is printed on the top-right of the page.

Obviously it only relies on open source stuff.
